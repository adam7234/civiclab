# CivicLab — Starter Site

This is a minimal scaffold for the CivicLab project.

Quick preview:

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps:
- Add a contact or sign-up form.
- Add project examples and contribution guidelines.
- Configure hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) and a simple CI workflow.
